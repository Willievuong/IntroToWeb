# Introduction To Web Backend 

## Introduction
Hi there! Somehow you've made your way to this repo, welcome! 
Essentially in my progress to become a better coder, I eventually evolved in some aspect into a teacher from a student.
I very quickly realized that a lot of the basic I taught was repetitive and I wasted a lot of time searching for same article.
So my solution was that I should create some sort of repo whose purpose was entirely starter code and detailed documentation to help facilitate teaching! And it would additionally provide a swath of resource for me to look back on in case I forget some detail!    

Although it is lacking as of now, my plan is to expand the amount of content there is in the repo! 

## Current Content 

### Javascript 
    - Intro to Axios 

### Python 
    - Intro to Flask 
    - Intro to Requests (A Python Package)
